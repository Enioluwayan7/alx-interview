# Min Operations

## Description

This project contains a Python script that calculates the minimum number of operations needed to generate exactly `n` 'H' characters in a text editor, starting with a single 'H'. The allowed operations are:
- **Copy All**: Copy all text in the editor.
- **Paste**: Paste the copied text.

The goal is to achieve exactly `n` characters using the fewest number of operations.

## Usage

To run the script, make sure the file is executable:

```bash
chmod +x min_operations.py
